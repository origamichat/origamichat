**Own your support, either use our pre-built `<Support />` component, or build your own based on our headless components.**

You know how most traditional support systems work: you load an external iframe and code within your app, making it harder to customize, use and even by time are being blocked by your users' ads blocker.

This approach worked well until you need to customize your support and more recently, when you're trying to build AI agents that can truly be helpful with custom tools and logic. **You need control over the code to give true power to your agents.**

This is what Cossistant aims to solve. It is built around the following principles:

- **Open source:** You and the community can participate in making the tool safer and more powerful, no opaque black box.
- **Open components:** Following shadcn/ui philosophy, every components used in `<Support />` are based on headless primitives available to you.
- **Code first:** A single source of truth within your codebase to defined your agents and support behavior
- **Beautiful Default:** The default `<Support />` comes with a carefully crafted support experience, powerful and beautiful as is
- **AI-Ready:** Open code and code first for LLMs to read, understand, and improve.
