## Philosophy

The `<Support />` component is built on the principle of **simplicity first**. Drop it into your React app and get a fully functional support system without configuration overhead.

## How it Works

- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with sensible defaults
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, customize as needed
- **Real-time Chat**: Built-in WebSocket support for live conversations
- **Smart Routing**: Automatically routes conversations to appropriate channels
- **Headless Architecture**: Full control through primitive components when needed

The component handles the complexity of modern support systems while maintaining a clean, minimal API surface.
