# Cossistant Code of Conduct

Welcome to Cossistant! Whether you're here to contribute, report bugs, or just hang out, weâ€™re happy to have you.

Hereâ€™s how we keep this place friendly and productive:

## ðŸ’¬ Be Cool

- Treat everyone with respect. No harassment, hate speech, or personal attacks.
- Thereâ€™s always a human behind the username. Be mindful.
- If youâ€™re frustrated, take a breath before you reply.

## ðŸ›  Keep Things Focused

- Use **GitHub** for anything related to the project: bug reports, feature requests, code discussions. This keeps things organized.
- Use **Discord** for casual chat, questions, and brainstorming. But serious issues belong on GitHub.

## ðŸ’¡ Share the Love

- Cossistant is open-source, built on the work of others. Please credit and respect that.
- If you build something using Cossistant, let us know! Weâ€™d love to check it out.
- Transparency matters. Keep your contributions open and honest.

## ðŸ”’ Keep It Safe

- Contribute clean and secure code. No malware, no shady stuff.
- Submitting AngularJS code is strictly forbidden. Seriously. Just donâ€™t.

## ðŸš¨ Reporting Issues

If you spot a problem with someoneâ€™s behavior, email **anthony@cossistant.com** privately.
All reports will be handled quietly and respectfully.

---

**Summary:**
Be respectful, keep things open, and write good code.
Just donâ€™t use AngularJS. Ever.
